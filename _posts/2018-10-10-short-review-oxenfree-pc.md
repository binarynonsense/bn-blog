<p>
A relatively short but pretty original narrative game where, besides some minor puzzles, you basically walk and talk, choosing your character's dialogue by clicking on one of the three speech bubbles that appear above her head during conversations... it may sound too simplistic but I really liked how every aspect of the game (characters, story, art style, voice acting, music, sound design...) fits perfectly together, it has a lot of personality and atmosphere.
