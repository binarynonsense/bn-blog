I've been recording videos of the game since I started its development (about 3 months ago, without almost any knowledge of DirectX or Bullet Physics). It's very very far from finished but I feel it's a good time to make a first video showing the evolution from the first tests to how it looks today, so I've selected some key videos and made this 'bundle'.<br /><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><iframe height="420" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/5UUaVJb2D3A" width="520"></iframe></div>
