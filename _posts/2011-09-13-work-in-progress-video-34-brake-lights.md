Nothing too spectacular but nice to have: now, when you press the brake key the car's brake lights go on. Some time ago, in a modding site about GTA: San Andreas, I read how the vehicle models were made in that game to indicate which parts were lights (i.e. tail right light, head right light...) to apply a different texture if the light is on. Basically, each light has a different material with a 'unique' diffuse value so you just have to look for one of those values when rendering the mesh. I've modified one model, the van, to try to make something similar and it works fine:<br /><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><iframe height="367" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/tfpyQI1WYrA?theme=dark" width="600"></iframe><br /></div>
