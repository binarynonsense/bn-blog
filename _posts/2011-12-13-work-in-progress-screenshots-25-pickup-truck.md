I found some free models on the <a href="http://forum.unity3d.com/threads/114822-Free-models-for-Christmas">Unity3D forum</a> created by the people from <a href="http://ilp3d.com/">ilp3d.com</a> who, very kindly, made them available to use 'in any way you like'. I don't use Unity3D but I've managed to extract the pickup truck model from the Unity package that can be downloaded from the forum, made some modifications to adapt it to my needs, and loaded it in my game:<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-aTIU6EwTwF8/TuahfJSltJI/AAAAAAAAAOU/kN9ikR-rigE/s1600/blog.binarynonsense.com_20111213_2.jpg" /></div><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-nwpMmVO9AiY/TuahjbZ1cgI/AAAAAAAAAOg/AdT9-PSENpo/s1600/blog.binarynonsense.com_20111213_1.jpg" /></div>
