<p><a href="https://binarynonsense.itch.io/highentropy">Minor update</a>< to add some small changes based on feedback I received for version <a href="http://blog.binarynonsense.com/2019/05/30/high-entropy-test-build-0-3-0/">0.3.0</a>.<br></p>
<p><em>Changelog:</em></p>
<ul><li>Level 9: changed the interactive double doors below to a fixed broken version to eliminate an unplanned way to finish the level more easily than I wanted.</li><li>Level 13: moved the walking turrets' start position a little ahead so people replaying/speedrunning the level don't have to wait so long for them to get to a safe position.</li><li>Disabled climbing while reloading weapons.</li></ul>
