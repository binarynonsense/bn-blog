I wasn't happy with the roads, so I've made them a little wider and improved the textures. The sidewalks are now independent. They're not finished yet, but here's a screenshot:<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-g_IWw3N1gfQ/Te4fM8Xp7tI/AAAAAAAAAEU/tbftbBtb634/s1600/blog.binarynonsense.com_20110514.jpg" /></div><br />PS: I found two new free car models :)
