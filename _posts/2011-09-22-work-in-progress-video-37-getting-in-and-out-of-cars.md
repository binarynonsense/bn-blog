Now, you can get in and out of cars. There's no animation, your character just appears besides the car when you get out or disappears when you get in, I guess it's fine for now. To get out of a car it has to be stopped or almost stopped and have enough space for your character at the left side of the car (if you press the key to get out but there's not enough space nothing will happen), and you can only get in parked cars. <br /><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><iframe height="367" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/9W-EPA95x-o?theme=dark" width="600"></iframe><br /></div>
