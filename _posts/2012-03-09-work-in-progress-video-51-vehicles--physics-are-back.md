I have the vehicles, with physics, working again (not the sound). With the new improved code it should be easier to create, destroy, customize and manage them. Also, now AI and players use the same interface to send them commands (accelerate, turn...), which will be cleaner than what I first implemented.<br /><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><iframe height="367" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/_rzSb6o25s4" width="600"></iframe></div>
