<p>
The gameplay is simple, a mix of platforming and puzzle solving, but the beautiful art, endearing character design and lovely music make it a short but very charming game. Its cartoonish design can be deceiving at first, the story, although pretty basic, is deeper than it seems, and there are some dark and emotional moments.

<p>Despite a few flaws, the controls are a little clunky at times and the puzzles can get repetitive, it got me invested in helping the protagonist reach the end of his adventure, something not every game manages to do, and I was always excited to investigate its vibrant and strange environments trying to figure out what I needed to do next.
