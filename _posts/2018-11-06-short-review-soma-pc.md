<p>
A really well crafted experience: the visuals perfectly match the sci-fi setting and intriguing story and the sound design is top notch, full of ambient noises that add a lot of believability and often unsettle you while you are distracted looking around the remarkably designed levels, which many times reminded me of some of my favorite games like Doom 3 or Bioshock, a mix of technology and industrial, metallic parts with water and organic elements (I especially liked the sections where you have to move underwater, loved their murky and otherworldly atmosphere).

The seamless way you can interact with many of the objects in the environments adds a lot to the immersiveness, and there are some puzzles to give a little variety to the gameplay and a few enemies you have to avoid (there's no combat at all), but not too many, just enough to add the right amount of tension to the exploration, which is the core of the game and my favorite part about it. An amazing adventure, engaging from start to end.
