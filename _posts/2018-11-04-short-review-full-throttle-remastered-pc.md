<p>
As I was afraid from what I remembered from the original's reviews (despite loving Lucasarts graphic adventures I decided not to get this one back in the day) I didn't like Full Throttle as much as I hoped. The remastered visuals are great, very similar to what they did with <a href='http://blog.binarynonsense.com/2016/11/04/short-review-day-of-the-tentacle-pc/'>Day of the Tentacle</a> (being faithful enough to the original style while making things more defined) but it's too short, I didn't like most of the puzzles that much and the action minigames mostly just annoyed me. The main character and biker thematic are very promising at first and give the game a unique personality, but the story is too simple and the characters you meet and places you visit are few and a little dull. Maybe I was expecting too much, but for me it's been entertaining but disappointing, especially for a Lucasarts adventure.
