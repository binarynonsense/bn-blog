<p>Maybe not as good as the first one but a really fun RPG nonetheless, with most of the things I love about other games made by Piranha still present. The pirate themed story and characters fit really well with the type of enviroments and gameplay Piranha are good at, and the world is good looking, especially the jungle areas, and fun to explore, although I probably didn't like it as much as the one in <a href="http://blog.binarynonsense.com/2016/09/20/micro-review-risen-pc/">Risen</a>, maybe because this time, instead of being just one big island, it's divided in a series of separated areas, some of them relatively small. Melee combat, my least favorite thing about the first game, is a little different but still clunky, but once you get some firearms, especially a musket, fighting gets easier and much more satisfying.</p>
