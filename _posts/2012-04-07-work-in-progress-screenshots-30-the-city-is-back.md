I'm putting the city back together. I want to have a working demo with all that I've made so far, which was my original goal, and take some time apart from this project to learn some other things, like Unity, and/or make a shooter...<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-uQs9sjMUgkM/T4CFlRa3-5I/AAAAAAAAATA/4ZXJabJ2Q9c/s1600/blog.binarynonsense.com_20120407194512.jpg" /></div><br />Main things I've yet to do to have what I want for the demo: integrate back the pedestrians, the HUD and the taxi missions into my new code; plus some other minor details.
