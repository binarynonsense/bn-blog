<p>
Thimbleweed Park successfully managed to bring back my memories of playing some Lucasfilm Games adventures of the late eighties and early nineties for the first time. It especially evokes the look and feel of Zak McKracken and Maniac Mansion but adds some modern touches that make it nicer looking while keeping enough of the essence of the original art style and gameplay mechanics to fit perfectly among them.</p> 

<p>
A really good throwback to some of my favorite point-and-click adventures. Fun to play from start to finish, with good and fair puzzles, light humor and peculiar characters.
