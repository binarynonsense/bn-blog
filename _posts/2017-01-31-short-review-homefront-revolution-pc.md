<p>A flawed but very entertaining game. If you can get used to the horrible spawn system for the enemies (you often see them suddenly appear or disappear around you), this is a very fun FPS that, gameplay-wise, has some similarities to the latest Far Cry games (unlocking areas of the map by conquering enemy bases and other key locations, buying and upgrading your weapons with the money and points you earn...). The enemy AI is not that great but the combat feels good and the visual design is quite attractive, with some environments that reminded me of the destroyed cities of films like "Terminator Salvation", one of my favorite things about that movie, adding a great atmosphere to the game that helps you feel part of a resistance movement in an occupied city.</p>
