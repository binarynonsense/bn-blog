<p>Like the <a href='http://blog.binarynonsense.com/2012/07/18/micro-review-borderlands-pc/'>first one</a>, the gameplay is very repetitive and the story is really simple but I love the visual design, the combat is very satisfying and extremely addicting and it's quite long (it took me more than 40 hours to finish the main story, and I still have some secondary missions and all the DLCs to play). One of my favorite shooters.</p>
