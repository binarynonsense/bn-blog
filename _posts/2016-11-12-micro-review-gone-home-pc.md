<p>Good looking and atmospheric, it's a brief but enjoyable narrative experience. No puzzles, no combat... you just explore a house examining some of the objects you find lying around to piece together the story. Not a game for everyone, but I really liked looking around its nicely designed 90's big house trying not to miss any important detail.</p>
