<p>As much as I liked the previous two, Risen 3 may be the one I had more fun playing. The design and core gameplay are very similar and all the things I liked about <a href="http://blog.binarynonsense.com/2016/10/03/micro-review-risen-2-pc/">Risen 2</a> are still present, with one key improvement: the melee combat (maybe I just got used to it but I enjoyed sword-fighting a lot more this time). Like the other games made by Piranha that I've played, Risen 3 is among the few that has managed to make me want to take the time to visit every inch of the world (the environments look even better on this one) and try to finish as many quests as possible.</p>
