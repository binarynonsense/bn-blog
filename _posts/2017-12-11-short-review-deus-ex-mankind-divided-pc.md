I love the version of Prague they created for this game, it's a great looking and believable mix of near-future technology with modern and old architecture that is a joy just to walk around. A great improvement from what I recall of the previous game's environments.

<p>
When it comes to the gameplay, it's quite similar to Human Revolution, mostly a refinement of the mechanics, which is totally fine with me because I really liked that one. I enjoyed a lot taking a non lethal approach with this one, looking for vents to go around security guards, hacking everything I saw... the freedom to choose how you face the missions is still one of my favorite things about these games.

<p>
The story is good in general, especially some of the more intriguing side missions, and the futuristic world and characters they've built around it are convincing and interesting; but it's clear that a sequel was/is planned, leaving some parts of the story unresolved when you reach the end... my only complaint about the game is that, as much as I enjoyed my time playing it, part of me felt that the ending was a little bit abrupt and unsatisfying.
