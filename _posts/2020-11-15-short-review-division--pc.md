<p>
A very similar experience to the sequel, which I <a href='https://blog.binarynonsense.com/2020/04/12/short-review-division-2-pc/'>played some time ago</a>, so, as I was hoping, I had a lot of fun playing this one too. Maybe even more.
</p>
<p>
I found its semi-abandoned, snowed version of New York an amazing environment for a game, an uncanny but gorgeous place to roam around and explore. It had an incredible amount of details and tons of atmosphere, with the snow and puddles, the day-night cycle and the weather changes creating some visual variety and random memorable moments that added much to the immersion: the beauty of the light during the first hours of the day, the eeriness of some areas at night, the snow storms reducing the visibility to just a few meters...
<p>
I truly enjoyed its simple, yet addictive, looting and shooting mechanics, but the art design and stunning technology that made the city feel like a real place were probably what impressed me the most and made me eager to keep playing.

Note: Like with The Division 2, the campaign was perfectly playable solo.
