<p>In this post, I want to write a little about what I've been doing lately and my plans for the next series of test versions (0.2.X). Their main focus will be adding cargo moving, loading and unloading jobs, I've started working on them and have a functional forklift already running in the game:<br></p>

<p>I have various ideas for these new  jobs and have been making some tests, but I'm not entirely happy with the results, so I'll be working on that in the near future (and a bunch of bug fixes and other things I have in my <a href="https://trello.com/b/pOQu4O93/hi-public-todo-bugs" target="_blank">ToDo lists</a>). In the meantime, people can still check the current test version and leave feedback. <br></p>
<p>Thanks to everyone that's left comments in the forums so far, if more people could write feedback about the machines the game works on (the hardware specs, average fps), bugs... it would be much appreciated (more info about specific things I'm looking for and how to leave feedback can be found <a href="https://itch.io/t/241507/feedback-guidelines" target="_blank">in the forums</a>).<br></p>
