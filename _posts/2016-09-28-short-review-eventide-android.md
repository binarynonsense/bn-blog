<p>Very similar gameplay mechanics, length and quality to the Secret Order games<a href="http://blog.binarynonsense.com/2016/09/23/micro-review-the-secret-order-2-android/"> I played last week</a>. The interface sometimes feels less responsive (there were a few times when the game didn't recognize the position I was touching correctly) and some of the puzzles and hidden object sections aren't as good, but the story, inspired by Slavic myths, is a little more original and the artwork is quite charming and colorful.</p>
