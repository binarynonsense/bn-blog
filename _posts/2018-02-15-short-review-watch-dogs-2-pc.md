<p>
Based on the solid foundations set by the first Watch_Dogs, a game <a href="http://blog.binarynonsense.com/2017/01/21/short-review-watch-dogs-pc/">I quite liked</a>, this one adds a few improvements to the gameplay mechanics and more light-hearted story and characters, which the colorful San Francisco area environment it takes place in fits quite nicely.
</p>

<p>
The missions are a little more varied, including some very entertaining side missions, and playing stealthy avoiding killing enemies, which I felt was more fitting due to the main character's personality, was more feasible and fun this time around.

<p>
I'm glad that, after the mixed reviews the first game had, they didn't decide to discard everything I enjoyed about it to make a fresh start but instead kept iterating the formula.
