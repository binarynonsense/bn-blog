I've been implementing the necessary code to be able to apply post processing effects to the game in real time. The following video shows some test effects:<br /><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><iframe height="420" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/46ZDnUHPV9k" width="520"></iframe></div><br />I'll probably use this for things like gradually blurring the image as the car increases velocity or changing the image somehow when there's a collision and the player is hurt... effects like that.
