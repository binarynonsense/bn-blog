<p>Also, I've made an Android companion app for the game. It's not needed at all to play the game, but I thought it was a fun side-project to make, and maybe some people will find it useful. You can download it from <a href="https://binarynonsense.itch.io/helos-cheatsheet" target="_blank">its itch page</a>.<br></p>
