<p>
I enjoyed it almost as much as Dishonored 2, the gameplay is mostly the same and the only drawback is that it's a shorter experience (took me around half the time to finish this one), so <a href="http://blog.binarynonsense.com/2018/04/08/short-review-dishonored-2-pc/">everything I wrote</a> about the previous game still applies. A great way to have a little more fun in the extraordinary world of Dishonored and learn more about Daud, Billie and the Outsider.
