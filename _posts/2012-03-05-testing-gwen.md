Today I've integrated another GUI library into my code to test it. This one is called <a href="http://code.google.com/p/gwen/">GWEN</a>. I've to make more tests to see how much it can be customized but I like it so far, it could be used to make an editor or some game menus, and it was quite easy to integrate. <br /><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><iframe height="367" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/lWk3N1WN43o" width="600"></iframe></div>
