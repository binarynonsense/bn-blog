<p>A fun adventure with a bunch of great characters and a lot of action and humor that plays exactly like other recent games by Telltale. The graphics look a little dated at times, especially some of the backgrounds, but the art design is really good and very faithful to the original material and the voice acting is remarkable. A really good game if you enjoy these type of simple adventure games and, even more, if you like the Borderlands universe.</p>
