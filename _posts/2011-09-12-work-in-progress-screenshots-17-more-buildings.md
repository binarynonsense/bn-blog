I bought a pack of three buildings so I have less things to model myself. I'm losing more time than I wanted to modifying them to repair some errors and adapt them to my needs, but they were quite cheap and I think they look good among the ones I already had in the game and the ones I haven't modeled yet. <br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-HxIE11dlCv4/Tm5C1iN9ZYI/AAAAAAAAAK4/5td8FMwb53Y/s1600/blog.binarynonsense.com_20110912_1.jpg" /></div><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-RTws7rTPFYM/Tm5C4yoWFDI/AAAAAAAAALA/0qOKAJbn1IE/s1600/blog.binarynonsense.com_20110912_2.jpg" /></div>
