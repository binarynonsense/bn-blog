<p>Not as bas as I was expecting but it's, by far, the worst game I've played made by Telltale, one of my favorite developers. The game is full of quick time events, with little else left to do except some brief conversations and a few extremely simple puzzles.</br>
The story and environments, even though they're nothing special, are the only reasons I enjoyed playing it, and probably only because I'm a fan of the movies.</p>
