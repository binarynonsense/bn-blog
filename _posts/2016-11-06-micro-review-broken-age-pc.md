<p>A little disappointing. The art design is quite beautiful and the story has a few engaging moments but, in general, it's just a decent but not great point-and-click adventure with not too memorable puzzles and a maybe too simplified interface. Definitely not as good as I was hoping it would be when they announced its crowdfounding campaign.</p>
