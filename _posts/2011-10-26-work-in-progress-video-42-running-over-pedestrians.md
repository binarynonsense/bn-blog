Someday, I want to implement <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ragdoll_physics">ragdolls</a> for this but, until then, I've decided to add a falling down/dying animation for the pedestrians that triggers when a vehicle runs over them. It isn't very spectacular or realistic and still needs a little tweaking but it is an improvement.<br /><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><iframe height="367" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/ha4t69JTlZI?theme=dark" width="600"></iframe></div>
