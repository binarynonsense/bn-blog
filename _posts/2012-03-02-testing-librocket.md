I've integrated <a href="http://librocket.com/">libRocket</a> (a C++ user interface middleware package based on the HTML and CSS standards) into my code to test it. Although it is quite interesting, I probably won't end up using it to make the game menus. I may test another library called GWEN but, right now, I'm thinking about programming my own code to add simple menus...<br /><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><iframe height="367" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/UdEv9zwralQ" width="600"></iframe></div>
