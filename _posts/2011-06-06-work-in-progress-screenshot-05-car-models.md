I bought some low-poly car models so I have less things to model on my own. I have to make some changes and improvements (some of the textures are probably too small and need more detail, for example), and spend some time adapting them so I can use them with my code, but I hope I'll save some time in the end. <br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-6YzUoEpxlJ0/Te4erbuDdVI/AAAAAAAAAEE/pohuufd8NvQ/s1600/blog.binarynonsense.com_20110706.jpg" /></div>
