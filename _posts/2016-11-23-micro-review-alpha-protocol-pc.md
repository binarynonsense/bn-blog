<p>A fairly entertaining but flawed spy-themed action game with some RPG elements. The level design feels mostly uninspired, with some areas looking very unpolished, the enemy AI is not that great, some of the menus and controls are poorly adapted for keyboard and mouse... but the core gameplay is quite fun and the story is good enough to make you want to see it through. Not a bad game at all, but could have been a really good one with a little more work.</p>
