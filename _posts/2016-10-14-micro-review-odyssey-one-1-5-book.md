<p>Got the first one on sale because it was cheap and looked interesting and, shortly after I started reading it, I was liking it so much that I decided to buy the other four books of the series that were also on sale. A very entertaining, non-stop action, military sci-fi story full of really well written space battles (and a few ground battles too). The only one that disappointed me a little was the fifth one, because it is slightly shorter than the rest and the story doesn't end with it... so I'll have to wait to know how things end.</p>
