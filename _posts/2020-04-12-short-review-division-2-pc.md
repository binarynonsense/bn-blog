Its derelict version of Washington D.C. is eerily beautiful, an incredible experience just to walk around, and full of interesting landmarks and interiors to admire during the large number of missions and activities available. You are mostly doing the same few things over and over and the missions themselves are all, at their core, basically an excuse to take you through a series of combat areas connected through closed doors that open once you kill all the enemies in that section... but the looting and shooting is quite addictive thanks to the tight mechanics and the amazing scenery you get to visit.
