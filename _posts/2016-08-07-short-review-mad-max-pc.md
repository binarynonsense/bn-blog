<p>An excellent open world game that perfectly captures the spirit of the movies. The map is big, full of beautiful scenery, very detailed and surprisingly varied; and the combat, both on foot and driving, is really fun. The main missions are fine, the story has some interesting situations and characters, but I got most of my many hours of entertainment just exploring the world, getting resources to upgrade my character and vehicle, and doing the side missions (there are a lot of them around the map, but only a handful of types, so they can get repetitive after a while).</p>
