<p>Keeping the gameplay and types of enemies mostly the same, most of the work on this sequel clearly went into improving the visual design and variety of environments. This time, there are a lot more different places to visit and many of them look great, even by today's standards, especially the lighting... Because of this, Dead Space 2's doesn't feel as unique as the first one did, but not every game needs to, even less in the case of the first sequel of an already quite original game. Given the solid foundations of <a href="http://blog.binarynonsense.com/2016/07/05/micro-review-dead-space-pc/">Dead Space</a>, the developers took the "safer" route and centered their efforts in doing more of the same but better, which, given the results, I personally think was the right way to go. If, like me, you enjoyed the first one and mostly just want a similar but improved experience, it's definitely a great game to play.</p>
