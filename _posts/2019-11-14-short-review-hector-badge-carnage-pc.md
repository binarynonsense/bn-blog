Not much of a challenge and quite basic technically and artistically, there's something endearing about its crass, anti-hero protagonist and crude, British humor that saves it from mediocrity. It's a type of comedy not everyone will enjoy, but if you do it makes for a decent and somewhat different point-and-click adventure with some amusing dialogues and situations.
