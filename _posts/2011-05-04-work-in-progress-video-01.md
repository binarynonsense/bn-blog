First public 'work in progress' video of the game I'm developing. I started some weeks ago and it's still very far from being a game, but I feel I've reached a point where I can start showing some 'work in progress' videos.<br /><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><iframe height="420" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/QV7YxA-K_2Y" width="520"></iframe></div><br />I'm programming it using C++ and DirectX 9.0c. My chosen physics engine is <a href="http://bulletphysics.org/">Bullet Physics</a>. Models and textures are mostly placeholders right now (the two car models in the video are free models available at <a href="http://www.psionic3d.co.uk/">www.psionic3d.co.uk</a> slightly modified ). No sound for now.
