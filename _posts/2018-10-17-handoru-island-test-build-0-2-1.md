<p>A minor update to add a few bug fixes and changes:</p>
<ul><li>(FIX) Timer showing in forklift jobs, when it shouldn't, if you did a previous job of another type that used it.</li><li>Disabled the supermarket interior (right now it was just a big place with nothing to do).</li><li>Increased a little how many seconds a day takes, but&nbsp;not by much (I still want it to be quite fast for testing purposes).</li><li>The HUD now pops an info line showing how many diamonds you've "lost" after you give them to the diamonds 
dealer. And you get XP and money after you give him 10, but I don't 
think there are enough in the map to test that yet.
</li></ul>
