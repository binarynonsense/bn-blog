These days, I'm trying to add a new type of mission to the game, but I've also had time to improve, a little, how the pedestrians move: now, they don't make sudden changes in direction anymore, they turn gradually (if they want to make a 180ยบ change in direction, for example, they don't do it instantly like before, something that looked very unnatural); also, they avoid objects like parked cars, benches... there are still many circumstances where they get stuck, so I'll have to work more on this area.<br /><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><iframe height="367" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/xJXh10QODvE?theme=dark" width="600"></iframe></div>
