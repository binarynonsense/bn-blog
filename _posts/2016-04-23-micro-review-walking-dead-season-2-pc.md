<p>A wonderful game. Like the <a href="http://blog.binarynonsense.com/2013/01/12/micro-review-walking-dead-pc/">first season</a>, it's one of those few games that really makes you feel a strong connection with the characters and try to carefully think about, and sometimes even regret afterwards, the choices you make.</p>
