<p>
One of those rare games that managed to leave me with a long lasting impression. While, at its core, still a puzzle platformer like Limbo, it felt more forgiving when it came to the design of the platforming sections and more focused on telling a story through its carefully crafted environments and puzzles. The pacing is really well thought-out and the visual design is striking, simple but very effective it oozes style and atmosphere.
