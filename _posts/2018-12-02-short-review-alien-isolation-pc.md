A game that oozes tension and atmosphere. The art, sounds and overall recreation of Alien's retro futuristic machinery and environments are perfect and make you feel almost like you are really there, wanting to explore every nook and cranny but constantly afraid of encountering the imposing Alien or some of the creepy androids that wander around.

I was close to finding the survival/stealth core of the gameplay a little too repetitive a few times during my playthrough and, as good as they look, most of the areas of the station started to look too similar after a while... but the pacing is very well thought out, alternating the different types of enemies and situations, limited in number as they are, at the right moments and adding a few unique looking places from time to time, so I never really reached a point where that repetitiveness lessened the experience. Really worth playing if you are a fan of the movie and/or this type of games.
