<p>
A decent but unremarkable game in general, it really shines in its amazing recreation of the Star Wars universe. The story is not bad but a little disappointing given its promising initial premise. It looks like it's going for something more original than usual at first, but it quickly becomes just the typical 'good guys save the day' adventure. Enjoyable enough, but a wasted opportunity.

The core of the gameplay, the shooting, is basic but feels good, despite an enemy AI that sometimes has weird behaviors that can ruin the immersion, and the space combat sections, after I got used to the controls, ended up being one of the highlights of the game for me... entertaining at best if you don't care much about the source material, but the exceptional audio and visuals add a lot to the experience if you do.
