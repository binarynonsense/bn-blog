<p>Minor update to add some small fixes and improvements.<br></p>
<p>Changelog:</p>
<ul><li>Added a small text at the bottom of the view area showing the page number in full-screen mode, or when the toolbar is disabled (and the menu option to disable it if the user doesn't want/like it)</li><li>FIX: set "en" as the current locale if the one asked for didn't exist. It was loading it correctly but not saving it to the settings.</li><li>FIX: generate the mime type of the page images correctly, although it didn't seem to matter :)</li></ul>
