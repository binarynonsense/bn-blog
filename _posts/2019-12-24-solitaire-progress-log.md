<p>The first public build of my solitaire project made with Godot is now available for windows and linux at <a href='https://binarynonsense.itch.io/solitaire'>https://binarynonsense.itch.io/solitaire</a></p>

<p>My plan was to also have a playable html5 version on the page, but I haven't been able to make the version Godot exports work anywhere (I'm new to the engine, so maybe I'm doing something wrong), it always gives an error loading the wasm file :( I'll keep trying, I really wanted to have the option to play it in the browser.</p>
