<p>Only worth it to finish the story, which isn't that great anyway, or maybe if you really liked the main game and want to play a little more, although this expansion is quite short (less than 5 hours) and the map is extremely linear and unappealing, consisting of too many caves and none of the bigger open forests that were my favorite parts of <a href="http://blog.binarynonsense.com/2016/09/07/short-review-arcania-pc/">ArcaniA</a>.</p>
