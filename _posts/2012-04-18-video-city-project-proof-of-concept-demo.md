I've decided it's about time I make the first working demo of the project, and the last few weeks I've been trying to implement what I'm calling a 'Proof of Concept' demo, given the early state of the project, that includes all that I've made so far. Here's a video:<br /><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><iframe height="367" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/s3Gi4p4PZrM" width="600"></iframe></div><br />I'm planning on publishing the demo this week when I've polished it a little more, in case someone is interested in checking it out or helping me test it.
