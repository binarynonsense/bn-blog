Perhaps not as good but worth playing if you enjoyed the original trilogy. I can't exactly pinpoint why but I don't think I liked it as much as the previous ones, although I had quite some fun with it.

With the same kind of humor, high quality voice acting, strange characters and beautiful 2D graphics, it somehow felt a little less charming. It may have been just the lack of novelty, because I liked the story and most of the puzzles. Things can get a little confusing near the end, but that happens to any decent story involving time travel and it was an interesting way to resume the plot after the trilogy's ending.
