This public test build, available at <a href="https://binarynonsense.itch.io/highentropy">itch.io</a>, includes the first 7 levels of the challenges mode. The story mode is not available.

After years of redesigns and prototypes I didn't like, I'm finally happy with how this project is shaping up. This build is a huge milestone for me, I hope you enjoy it (just keep in mind this isn't a finished game and there may be bugs I haven't found or fixed yet, although I've tested that all the levels can be completed with a 100% score).
