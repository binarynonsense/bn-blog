I've started working on the sound for the game. I was thinking about using OpenAL but, given I'm already tied to DirectX, I'm going to use DirectSound, at least for now, to program the sound manager for the game. <br /><br />Also, I need to create some sounds so I've been playing a little with <a href="http://audacity.sourceforge.net">Audacity</a> and some free sounds I found at <a href="http://www.freesound.org">Freesound.org</a>. The most difficult to create will probably be a good car engine sound loop (to generate the sound for the cars my plan is to loop a running engine sound, and change its frequency as a function of the car's speed... we'll see if that makes a believable sound).<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-3YLbUIQb0DY/TslpWRheAfI/AAAAAAAAANk/Apqg7kjfRuM/s1600/blog.binarynonsense.com_20111120_1.jpg" /></div><br />I've never done 3D sound programming or sound editing, so it will take me some time :)
