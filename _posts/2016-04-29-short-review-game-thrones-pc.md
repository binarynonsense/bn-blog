<p>The art style is original, sometimes quite beautiful, the storyline is interesting enough and it manages to capture the atmosphere of the TV series but, unlike <a href="http://blog.binarynonsense.com/2013/01/12/micro-review-walking-dead-pc/">The Walking Dead</a> and its <a href="http://blog.binarynonsense.com/2016/04/23/micro-review-walking-dead-season-2-pc/">sequel</a>, two great games with similar gameplay mechanics, playing this one I felt like my choices didn't matter that much most of the time. It's quite entertaining, especially if you like the series and/or books, but not as good as other recent Telltale games.</p>
