<p>A simple but enjoyable RPG where the map is composed of a series of open areas that you visit one after the other, with a small bunch of quests to do in each one. The combat is basic but fun, there is a good variety of enemies and the world looks quite nice given its age (although it's horribly optimized, you'll probably need a powerful PC, by today's standards, to run it well enough to be playable). It was originally part of the Gothic series, which I really like (especially the third one), so the visual design of the world will look familiar (and the lore and some characters) if you've played them.</p>
<p>Not great, and it starts to feel a little boring by the end (it took me about 25 hours to finish), but much better than I expected given some of the reviews I'd read over the years (besides the bad performance, the only thing I really didn't like about ArcaniA was the ending, which was very disappointing, leaving things unresolved, but hopefully <a href="http://blog.binarynonsense.com/2016/09/08/short-review-arcania-fall-of-setarrif-pc/">the expansion</a>, which I'm going to play next, will fix that).</p>
