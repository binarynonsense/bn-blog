<p>
A poster / potential new cover I painted for "High Entropy: Challenges", made in a similar style to the one I <a href="https://blog.binarynonsense.com/2021/12/25/art-he-poster-01/">recently did</a> for "High Entropy", the game I'm currently creating ("Challenges" is the already available free version of the game).
