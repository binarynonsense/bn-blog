<p>With this update, ACBR is now not only a reader but a converter of comic book files too.</p>
<p>Changelog:<br></p>
<ul><li>Added tools to:
<ul><li>Convert/Resize files from cbr, cbz, pdf or epub to cbz, pdf or epub.</li><li>Export the current page to an image file.</li></ul>
</li><li>Moved some of the cpu intensive work to child processes so the program doesn't feel unresponsive.</li><li>Added a loading spinner image to indicate when something is loading.</li><li>The file format is now deduced from the file data itself instead of from its extension (so, even if a cbz file is renamed to cbr it will be correctly detected as a zip compressed file).</li><li>A bunch more of small performance and usability tweaks...</li></ul>
