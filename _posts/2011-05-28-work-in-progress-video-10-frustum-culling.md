I've programmed some code for basic spatial scene management (dividing the map into 'cells' with their corresponding AABB which I use for frustum culling). This way, I've managed to increase my framerate a little. The video shows a larger map than the previous one.<br /><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><iframe height="420" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/y_9GRuBayPs" width="520"></iframe></div>
