<p class="text-justify">I've started fleshing out the area north of the first bridge. There are unfinished parts and I haven't added anything to do there gameplay-wise yet, but you can explore it to see how the environment is shaping up. I also improved the swimming code to allow the character to go from walking to swimming and viceversa, and added new particles, it may need some tweaking but it works and I think looks better. You can check the full changelog below.</p>
