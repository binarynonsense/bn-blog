Now, pedestrians collide with things and follow the terrain's height. Also, I've added a third person view where you control a pedestrian. There are many things to improve (for example, pedestrians controlled by the AI are quite stupid, they just try to keep walking when they collide with something), but it's a good start.<br /><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><iframe height="367" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/iqlj6xtfnSg?theme=dark" width="600"></iframe><br /></div>
