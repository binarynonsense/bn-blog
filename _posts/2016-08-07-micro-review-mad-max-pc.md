<p>An excellent open world game that perfectly captures the spirit of the movies. The map is big, beautiful, very detailed and surprisingly varied; and the combat, both on foot and driving, is really fun. If you enjoy exploring the world, getting resources to upgrade your character and vehicle and doing the side missions, they can get repetitive after a while, you'll be entertained for a lot of hours.</p>
