Yesterday, I bought some low-poly animated models of people and, after some problems with formats and animation sets, I have managed to integrate animated meshes on the game. I still have much work left to do to have pedestrians walking around the city, but it's a first step. The video shows a cop looping through 3 different animations.<br /><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><iframe height="367" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/snZGbtfo_88?theme=dark" width="600"></iframe><br /></div>
