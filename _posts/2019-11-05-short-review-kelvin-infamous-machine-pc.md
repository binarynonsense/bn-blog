<p>
A fairly successful attempt to make a less ambitious but competent LucasArts' style point-and-click adventure. It's a little too short but it has a nice art design (nothing fancy but well animated and with personality), fair puzzles and the characters, situations and dialogues are funny enough to make it worth playing if you are looking for a similar game and have already played all the classics.
