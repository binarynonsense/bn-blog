<p>I probably enjoyed it even more than the <a href="http://blog.binarynonsense.com/2013/04/24/micro-review-book-unwritten-tales-pc/">first one</a> and its <a href="http://blog.binarynonsense.com/2014/09/03/micro-review-book-unwritten-tales-critter-pc/">prequel</a>, and I really, really liked those games. A fantastic point-and-click adventure: excellent graphics and voice acting, satisfying puzzles, funny and likable characters, witty dialogues and a long story. The ending is its weakest point, it's not bad but it leaves some things unresolved (it's quite clear they plan on doing a sequel).</p>
