<p>A great excuse to replay my favorite point-and-click adventure of all time, this remastered version more interesting additions are the option to listen to commentary from the developers while playing and the new interface and high resolution graphics (I wasn't sure I'd like them but they look great and are very faithful to the original visual style, one of the many things I love about the game, and you have the option to switch to the old graphics any time you want). The game itself is short (took me less than 5 hours to finish) but as charming and funny as I remembered.</p>
