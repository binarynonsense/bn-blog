I haven't made much progress lately. I've been researching about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heightmap">heightmaps</a> and making some tests, and I think I may use them in the future to make a bigger map, with non-populated islands/areas outside the city or just to give more variety to the ground... I'm not sure if I'll dedicate more time to this right now or I'll put it on hold till I finish the list of things I had planned to do at this moment.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-MP3El9Wnc3k/Tp62uOwoM2I/AAAAAAAAAMM/9_k5wYy_0tc/s1600/blog.binarynonsense.com_20111019_1.jpg" /></div><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-4gIFEMAQtog/Tp62p9B9AnI/AAAAAAAAAMA/90PTxBGHM7Y/s1600/blog.binarynonsense.com_20111019_2.jpg" /></div>
