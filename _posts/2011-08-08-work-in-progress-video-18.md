It's been too long since my last update, so here goes a little post to prove I'm still working on the game :). I've been mostly reading programming books and making some experiments. Now I'm working on the algorithms to create the paths for the cars and the AI that will help them follow those paths and drive through the city so there's some more complex traffic... <br /><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><iframe height="371" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/gdQ72IXFCwM?theme=dark" width="600"></iframe><br /></div><br />For now, here goes a video showing the map I've built to test the algorithms as I create them. I've added shadows to the water, something I had forgotten to do :) and improved the vehicle reflections a little.<br />
