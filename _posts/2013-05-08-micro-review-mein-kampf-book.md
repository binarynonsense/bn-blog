<p>Book author: Adolf Hitler | My rating: 1/5</p>

<p>I give this book a one star rating because of the ideals it promotes and its lack of literary value. However, I think it's a very valuable asset to anyone interested in World War II given that, in this book Hitler himself wrote, some time after his failed coup of 1923, about the beginnings of the National Socialist Movement, his obsession and hate towards what he calls 'the international Jew', his view of the Aryan race as superior, the power of propaganda and public speeches, the People's State he envisioned, the need to acquire new territory... Some of the horrors perpetrated by the Nazi Germany years later are less surprising after reading it, making it seem quite strange how the rest of the world, with a few exceptions, ignored, or chose to ignore, this clear warning when Hitler reached power and started putting his plans for Germany into practice.</p>
