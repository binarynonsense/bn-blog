I wanted to add the possibility of making <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handbrake_turn">handbrake turns</a>, to make driving the cars more fun, so I've been experimenting with the friction values of the wheels and adding a handbrake key that, when pressed, applies a brake force to the rear wheels. It needs more work but I think making the car slide, and trying to control it at the same time, is already quite fun.<br /><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><iframe height="367" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/CbWKSFTFg1E?theme=darl" width="600"></iframe></div>
