<p>The first part of the book, about a third of the total length, was the one I found most interesting: a brief account of the story of the TRS-80 computer, from the first model's design to its commercial death, including a few anecdotes about some of the people who made software for it or just bought one. Besides a few brief chapters at the end about the computer magazines of those years and other TRS-80 related topics, the rest are the autobiographies of the book's authors, focusing on, but not restricted to, their experiences with the different TRS-80 models, and how they created and sold software for them... also interesting in its own way, but not as much as the initial chapters.</p>
