<p>The addition of superpowers to the gameplay mechanics changes things quite a bit, making Saints Row IV closer to games like Prototype than to the other games of the series...  I enjoyed playing this one a lot (the main story is simple but funny and entertaining, there are many things to do and collect around the city, although I didn't care much about many of the activities, and the powers are very fun to use), but I didn't like it as much as Saints Row 2 and 3, which are among my favorite open world games. That said, it's a very good "superheroes" game.</p>
