<p>I hadn't played a Tex Murphy game until now but, despite not being a fan of the series before, I really liked this one. Visually, the 3d environments are far from impressive, they range from not bad to quite ugly, but they serve their purpose well enough and the puzzles are relatively easy but entertaining and varied. The FMV sequences look better than the environments, except for some of the backgrounds, and are fun to watch, mostly because Tex Murphy is an interesting and funny character. It's definitely an adventure game worth playing if you enjoy the genre, even if you don't know much about the previous games.</p>
