I'm rewriting the code of my game project (I want to improve and redesign some elements now that I know what I'm doing a little better :D) and adding some new things. Today I've integrated <a href="http://www.antisphere.com/Wiki/tools:anttweakbar">AntTweakBar </a>into my code, a library that provides a simple GUI that could be useful to easily tweak some parameters. Here's a video of my first test:<br /><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><iframe height="367" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/tB4GmkfN7Ao" width="600"></iframe></div><br />From its <a href="http://www.antisphere.com/Wiki/tools:anttweakbar">website</a>: "AntTweakBar is a small and easy-to-use C/C++ library that allows programmers to quickly add a light and intuitive graphical user interface into graphic applications based on OpenGL, DirectX 9, DirectX 10 or DirectX 11 to interactively tweak parameters on-screen"
