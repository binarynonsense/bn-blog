<p>I had really fond memories of this game but it had been a really long time since I last played it, so I recently decided to replay it on my Android tablet using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ScummVM">ScummVM</a>.</p>
<p>It's quite easy and a little short but it still is as charming and nice looking as it was years ago (the visual style, which I loved back then, has aged really well). It's not as good as I remembered, but it's worth playing if you like point-and-click adventures.</p>
