<p>Recently, I saw a <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/mobile/artifex-mundi-pc-and-mobile">humble bundle</a> that included a bunch of well regarded hidden object games quite cheap for PC and Android and, although I had never played one, the genre seemed simpler but in some ways similar to graphic adventures, which is a type of game I really like, so it seemed like something I might enjoy playing on my Android tablet.</p>

<p>I had fun playing "The Secret Order 2: Masked Intent", the first one I've tried. The story is not that great but interesting enough and  serves as an excuse to take you through a series of areas, mostly static screens with a few animated elements and sometimes videos, where you find a bunch of simple puzzles and the hidden object sections. Technically it was better than I expected, very polished and nice looking, and the gameplay is relaxed but challenging enough to be enjoyable.</p>
