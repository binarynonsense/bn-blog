<p>Jimmy Maher is doing a remarkable job chronicling the history of interactive entertainment on his blog, and these free ebooks compiling his posts, sorted by the historical year, are a great way to read it.</p>
<p>All the volumes available so far can be downloaded from <a href="http://www.filfre.net/the-digital-antiquarian-e-book-library/">his website</a>.<p>
