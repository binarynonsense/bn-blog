I've implemented some code to modify the skinned models' animations, in real-time, using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse_kinematics">inverse kinematics</a>. The video shows how a walking animation is modified to make the model look at the camera if it's in his field of view while his right hand aims a weapon to something in front of him.<br /><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><iframe height="367" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/97AX87NBp9A?theme=dark" width="600"></iframe></div>
