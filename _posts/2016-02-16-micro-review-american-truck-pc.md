<p>If you like <a href="http://blog.binarynonsense.com/2016/01/10/micro-review-euro-truck-2-pc/">Euro Truck Simulator 2</a> you'll enjoy this one too: it's the exact same gameplay with similar graphics quality but in a very different environment with bigger and better looking cities. The map is a little small right now (there will be DLCs to expand it) and there are only three models of trucks to buy at this moment (they just added a new one), but the game is quite cheap for the hours and hours of entertainment it already provides. I love driving through Nevada's desert roads at night...</p>
