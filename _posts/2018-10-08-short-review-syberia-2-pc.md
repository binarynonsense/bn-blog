<p>
More than a sequel, this one feels like it was a part of <a href="http://blog.binarynonsense.com/2018/09/02/short-review-syberia-pc/">the first game</a> that was left out for lack of time or money. Technically and gameplay-wise it's exactly like Syberia, and the story continues right were it stopped... but I didn't enjoy it as much: I like how it provides a more satisfying end to the story, and at the very least it's worth playing just for that, but the environments are less awe-inspiring, it has a few obscure puzzles that annoyed me more than I had fun solving them, especially in the second half of the game, and A LOT of backtracking, making it a bit of a letdown compared to the original.
