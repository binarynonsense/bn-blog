What an amazing game, everything I liked about <a href="http://blog.binarynonsense.com/2018/02/03/short-review-dishonored-pc/">Dishonored</a> is still there but even better. Plays mostly exactly like the first game but the overall experience is a little more polished. The level design is superb, managing to include the things it requires to be a great stealth game (multiple paths, a lot of verticality...) while making the maps feel realistic, not just levels in a game built with only gameplay purposes in mind, thanks in big part to their slightly strange looking but awe-inspiring and believable architecture. It's a strange world, but the story, lore and characters make you feels like you are visiting a real place.

Probably the best stealth game I've ever played, trying to finish it without killing or being detected has been one of my favorite gaming experiences so far.
