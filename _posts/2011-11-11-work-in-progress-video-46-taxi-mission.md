I've just finished the first version of a new type of mission for the game: the taxi mission. Basically, you can start this mission if you're driving a taxi (pressing a key) and once it's started clients are generated, one at a time, so you can take them to some random destination before the time runs out. As long as you take the clients to their destination on time new clients will be generated. Not exactly original, but I've always liked this kind of missions.<br /><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><iframe height="367" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/YjSw98mFTSw?theme=dark" width="600"></iframe></div><br />The car model's doors don't open so I can't make the clients open the door before they enter the taxi, when they get close to the door I just make them disappear, and when they have to get out something similar happens. It's not too realistic but it will have to do.
