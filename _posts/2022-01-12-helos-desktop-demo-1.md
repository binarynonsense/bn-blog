My latest side project a fake remote desktop/interactive computer web simulation I'm creating (it's still a work in progress) as part of a 'secret' website related to the story mode of 'High Entropy', the PC game I'm making.

You can try this test version here: http://www.binarynonsense.com/wip/helos-desktop/

The idea is to have a hidden 'High Entropy Labs' (the fictional company from the game) website inside my own with info related to the story, passwords to access other areas and interactive fake computers like this to explore and find things inside (some of those passwords, for example) using commands like you do in the game itself, as an extra/complementary experience. Just something I thought would be fun to create.
